# Uncommon HTML Bug: Setting innerHTML to undefined variable

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML that can be difficult to track down. The bug involves attempting to set the `innerHTML` property of a DOM element to a variable that is not defined.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a simple HTML structure with a div element. A JavaScript script attempts to set the `innerHTML` of this div to a variable that is not defined (`myUndefinedVariable`).  This does not throw a JavaScript error, but silently fails to update the content of the div.  This kind of silent failure can be harder to debug than an explicit error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.html` file demonstrates the solution: checking if the variable exists before assigning it to `innerHTML`.  Alternatively, providing a default value would also solve the issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the content of the div remains unchanged because the variable is undefined.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` in a web browser and see the corrected output.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and variable checks when manipulating the DOM.
